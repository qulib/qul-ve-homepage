            On October 26th, 1954, a Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology opened
            in the Old Arts Building (modern Theological Hall), the home of
            Queen’s Theological College. This project reveals how the Museum
            came into being, a gallery of select items once included in the
            museum, and the context surrounding the sudden and tragic loss of
            such a culturally and educationally significant collection.

            The Young Ladies’ Journal (1864-1920) is an illustrated periodical
            that was marketed specifically to a young, female, middle-class
            audience. Each month, the YLJ published several fashion supplements
            that were distributed with its regular magazine issues. These
            supplements feature illustrated fashion spreads, needlework design
            and crafting templates, and dress patterns that could be cut out and
            traced onto fabric. When viewed together, these supplements provide
            a powerful visual demonstration of the relationship between fashion
            and consumer culture.

            Stereoscopic views, or stereo cards, consist of two photographs,
            taken from slightly different angles and mounted on card, that would
            appear three-dimensional when viewed through a stereoscope. Wildly
            popular in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries, they were an early
            mass medium that served a variety of social functions — ideological,
            aesthetic, or even spiritual — that have, thus far, received little
            scholarly attention.

            The Kelmscott Chaucer was the last and greatest work to arise from
            the partnership between the British Arts and Crafts design reformer
            William Morris and the late Pre-Raphaelite artist Sir Edward
            Burne-Jones. Originally owned by Lawrence of Arabia, the tooled
            leather-bound edition in the Queen’s collection is one of only 48 of
            its kind. “A Pocket Cathedral” presents this remarkable work of art
            among contemporary Private Press books whose intricate design, hand
            craftsmanship and social message share the same Arts and Crafts
            sensibility.
