            On October 26th, 1954, a Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology opened
            in the Old Arts Building (modern Theological Hall), the home of
            Queen’s Theological College. This project reveals how the Museum
            came into being, a gallery of select items once included in the
            museum, and the context surrounding the sudden and tragic loss of
            such a culturally and educationally significant collection.
